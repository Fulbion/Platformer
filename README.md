This is a little platformer engine I made. Maybe someday this will be an actual game.\
Also the game is framerate-independant: that means you can go to the `window.ini` file and change the FPS, the game is based on the delta time so it runs at the same speed!

# Installation
In order to test the demo, you can either download the release, or build the source code.

* The code requires the [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org) library (2.6 or later).
* You need to build it from Visual Studio (MinGW or Linux are not supported yet!).
