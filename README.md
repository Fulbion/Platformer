This is a little platformer engine I made. Maybe someday this will be an actual game.

# Installation
In order to test the demo, you can either download the release, or build the source code.

* The code requires the [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org) library (2.6 or later).
* You need to build it from Visual Studio (MinGW or Linux are not supported yet!).
